		<div class="accordionButton"><h4>What does Biotron&reg; do?</h4></div>
		
		<div class="accordionContent"><p>Biotron&reg; manufactures mineral amino acid chelates and complexes for use as nutritional supplement ingredients. Biotron has also successfully developed specialty products for our customers based on their own formulas and concepts.</p></div>

			<div class="accordionButton"><h4>What is a chelate?</h4></div>
			
		<div class="accordionContent"><p>In general terms, a chelate is a mineral sequestered in a 'molecular cage'. Surrounding the mineral in this manner provides two key functions: First, it prevents the formation of insoluble mineral precipitates in the stomach, which quickly pass through the digestive system and thus are of limited nutritional value. Secondly and more importantly, when critical nutrients such as amino acids are used as the building blocks of the 'cage', the mineral is carried to sites of maximal absorption along with the amino acids themselves. The result is a mineral nutrient that has enhanced 'bioavailabilty' with the added benefit of being gentle on the body, unlike the harsh inorganic mineral salts used in many nutritional supplements.</p>

			<div class="accordionButton"><h4>What amino acids are used in your chelates?</h4></div>
			
		<div class="accordionContent"><p>The Biotron&reg; Process of manufacture utilizes the full spectrum of amino acids derived from enzymatically hydrolyzed natural proteins - rather than a single, chemically produced synthetic amino acid. This gives our chelates unique benefits: First, the product delivers a complete amino acid profile including 'essential' amino acids (those that must be consumed in the diet because the body is unable to produce them itself). Additionally, because these proteins are from a natural source, they have the added benefit of including trace amounts of other nutrients such as soy isoflavones - nutrients whose properties are just beginning to be understood. Furthermore, recent scientific evidence suggests that amino acids are taken up in short chains and not as single molecules<sup>1</sup>, Our manufacturing process delivers minerals sequestered in these short chains thus harnessing the body's own uptake mechanism to deliver highly available mineral nutrients<sup>2</sup>.</p>

			<div class="accordionButton"><h4>What is Biotron's average lead time?</h4></div>
			
		<div class="accordionContent"><p>Our manufacturing times vary based upon customer requirements. Often, our standard bulk mineral products are available for shipment immediately. For products requiring more extensive handling (for example, meeting a certain particle size requirement) expect a slightly longer lead time (2-4 weeks).</p>
</div>
		<!-- /end accordian-->
		
		
		
		<div class="accordionButton"><h4>Do you offer quantity discounts?</h4></div>
			
		<div class="accordionContent"><p>Yes. It's also often possible to enter contractual agreements that allow delivery of smaller quantities over an extended period of time to achieve volume price discounts.</p>
</div>
		<!-- /end accordian-->
		
		
		
		<div class="accordionButton"><h4>Do you have a minimum order size?</h4></div>
			
		<div class="accordionContent"><p>Because it takes a minimum amount of material to operate much of our processing equipment, we have a standard minimum order size of 25 kilograms for bulk powders, and custom blends are considered on a case-by-case basis. </p></div>
		<!-- /end accordian-->
		
		
		<div class="accordionButton"><h4>Do you ship worldwide?</h4></div>
			
		<div class="accordionContent"><p>Yes. Biotron&reg; works with companies in North and South America, Europe, the Middle East, Australia and Asia.</p></div>
