						<p>The World Health Organization reports that Iron deficiency is the most common global nutrition deficiency &mdash; in both developing as well as industrialized nations. </p>

						<h2>An estimated 2 billion people suffer from persistent iron deficiency &mdash; resulting in fatigue, increased susceptibility to illness as well as impaired memory and motor performance.  Similarly, poor birth outcomes, including prematurity and low birth weight have been associated with anemia during pregnancy.  Poor iron bioavailability of dietary iron is cited as the primary causal factor in people with low iron status. </h2>

						<p>Often, health professionals will prescribe supplementary iron (in the form of capsules, tablets, sachets or syrups) containing harsh iron salts to treat iron deficiency anemia and low serum ferritin. However, compliance with these recommendations is often poor due to the adverse effects associated with most commercial iron products. These include gastrointestinal upset, nausea, and bloating.</p>

						<h2>Building on the years of success with Ferrotron&reg;, Ferrotron&reg; Forte' is a unique, high potency iron preparation designed to supply 29 mg daily of dietary iron (160% of the recommended daily intake) while minimizing or eliminating these undesirable side effects.  </h2>

						<h2>Ferrotron&reg; Forte' contains:</h2>

						<p>Ferrotron&reg; Forte Contains Ferractiv&reg;. Biotron Laboratories clinically studied Iron (10%) Amino Acid Chelate which has been shown to significantly lower the number of adverse events in a double blind, placebo controlled study of 60 healthy premenopausal women (Published in the Journal of Dietary Supplements, 10(1):17-28, 2013).  Ferractiv&reg; has been shown to be easy to absorb and demonstrates an exceptional safety profile - making it the ideal form of iron.</p>



						<p>Available as easy to swallow hard shell capsules or a powder sachet for mixing in liquids, Ferrotron&reg; Forte' also contains important cofactors &mdash; such as vitamin C and copper &mdash; which are essential in improved absorption and maintenance of adequate iron. Quite simply, Ferrotron&reg; Forte' is among the very best iron products offered today.  </p>
